/*If a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a
program to calculate the sum of its digits.
(Hint: Use the modulus operator ‘%’)*/


#include<stdio.h>

	printf("i can't");
}
//See you have already done one program that seperates the five digits,
//Just some those variables and you will get the sum of these digits.
